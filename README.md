Convolution - is the process of obtaining features of an image using a filter of required size. This is done by a matrix operation between input image and the filter.

Filters/Kernels - is a matrix used to extract features and produce feature maps of an image.

Epochs - is the number of times we iterate over the training data set inorder to obtain all its significant features.

1x1 Convolution - is the process of convolving an image with 1*1 filter . This helps us in reducing the number of channels in an image.

3x3 Convolution - is a process of obtaining features of an image using a filter of size 3 * 3.

Feature Maps - are a group of features which are extracted from an image using the kernel of desired size.

Activation Function - is a function that helps us retain the prominent pixels of the feature maps generated by convolution.

Receptive Field - tells us how many pixels is a neural layer aware of. Global receptive field exists only for the last layer of a network and should be equal to size of an object.
